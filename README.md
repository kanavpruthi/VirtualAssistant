# VirtualAssistant

My first Virtual Assistant program that can play songs for you, flirt with you, keep you cheered up with jokes, and keep your homework on time with her limitless information bank. To set her up on your device, clone/fork/download the ZIP file, extract it in a folder, fire up a terminal and run "pip install ${name of package}" to install dependencies required. This project works on Python 3.9.x versions. 

After this initial setup, just run main.py and when you see/hear 'Listening', enter your command by voice, and you're set up.

Now the main issues that you might face after installing packages in the terminal, if you use VSCode are that after installation, the program might not work, so try restarting the IDE and is issue persists, install the packages individually from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ . Pictures will be uploaded soon, stay tuned. If you want to improve and contribute, please fork a copy and try it :)
